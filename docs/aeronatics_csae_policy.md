# AeroNatics Child Sexual Abuse & Exploitation (CSAE) Policy

_Last updated: 2025-11-07_

AeroNatics (“we”, “us”, “our”) maintains a zero-tolerance stance toward child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and any form of child sexual exploitation. This policy outlines how we define prohibited conduct, the safeguards we employ, and the ways you can report concerns to keep the community safe.

## 1. Scope and definitions
- **Child / minor** – any individual under the age of 18, or the age of majority in their jurisdiction if higher.
- **CSAM** – any depiction of a minor involved in sexual activity, nudity with sexual intent, or any sexualized portrayal of a minor (real, illustrated, audio, or text).
- **Exploitation and grooming** – attempts to solicit, coerce, or traffic minors; sharing personal contact details with sexual intent; or encouraging minors to create sexual content.

This policy covers all content and conduct on AeroNatics, including profiles, posts, captions, comments, private submissions, media uploads, and metadata.

## 2. Prohibited content and behaviors
We immediately block and escalate any of the following:

1. Uploading, linking to, or describing CSAM, including AI-generated or manipulated images.
2. Sexualized commentary about minors, including fantasies, fetishes, or romantic roleplay that involves minors.
3. Soliciting personal details, photos, meetups, or contact with minors for sexual purposes.
4. Attempting to groom or coerce minors via direct or indirect messages, leaderboards, or support channels.
5. Glorifying or encouraging child exploitation, trafficking, or abuse in any format.

## 3. Detection and safeguards
- **Automated checks** – media uploads are screened with industry-standard hashing (e.g., PhotoDNA) and heuristics supplied by Firebase Storage / Google Cloud Vision.
- **Human moderation** – flagged submissions and abuse reports are reviewed by trained staff.
- **Access limits** – minors cannot view sensitive leaderboards or location details that are marked 18+.
- **Account tools** – suspicious accounts are rate limited, quarantined, or blocked while investigations occur.

## 4. Enforcement actions
Violations of this policy result in one or more of:

- Immediate removal of the offending content and suspension or permanent ban of the account.
- Device and credential blocking to prevent re-registration.
- Preservation of evidence for handoff to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) or similar authorities.
- Notification to hosting providers and relevant law-enforcement agencies.

We reserve the right to act on reasonable suspicion even if an investigation is ongoing, prioritizing the safety of minors over product access.

## 5. Reporting CSAE concerns
If you encounter potentially exploitative content or behavior:

1. Use the in-app report button on the relevant profile or submission.
2. Email the Trust & Safety team at `aeronatics@googlegroups.com` with links, screenshots, and any contextual details you can safely provide.
3. If someone is in immediate danger, contact local law enforcement before notifying us.

We acknowledge receipt of CSAE reports within 24 hours and aim to take decisive action within 48 hours, barring requests from authorities to delay notice.

## 6. Cooperation with authorities
We comply with all applicable laws, including mandatory reporting obligations in the United States and other jurisdictions. When legally required, we share:

- Account identifiers, IP addresses, and device fingerprints.
- Content metadata, timestamps, and moderation notes.
- Copies of the offending material as mandated by NCMEC or law-enforcement.

Disclosures are narrowly tailored to the request, and we notify affected users unless prohibited by law or if doing so would compromise an investigation.

## 7. Updates to this policy
We periodically review this CSAE policy to reflect evolving regulations, best practices, and platform features. Material changes are announced in-app or via email with an updated “Last updated” date.

## 8. Contact
Questions or urgent concerns can be directed to: `aeronatics@googlegroups.com`.
