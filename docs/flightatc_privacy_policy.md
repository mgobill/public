# Flight ATC Privacy Policy

[← Back to App Launchpad]({{ '/' | relative_url }})

_Last updated: November 12, 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how Flight ATC (the “Game”) collects, uses, and shares information about you.

## 1. Information we collect
We only collect the information needed to run the public leaderboard and keep your best score in sync.

### Player-submitted information
- **Player name** – optional nickname you enter when you achieve a qualifying score. It does not need to be your real name.
- **Game score** – stored with your player name and anonymous ID to display leaderboard rankings.

### Automatically collected information
- **Anonymous user ID** – created through Firebase Authentication to uniquely identify your leaderboard entry. It is random and not linked to personal data.

### Information stored locally on your device
- **Personal best score** – kept in your browser’s local storage so you can see your “Best” score. It never leaves your device unless you submit it to the leaderboard.

## 2. How we use your information
- Operate and maintain the public leaderboard.
- Ensure fairness by tying each entry to one anonymous ID so a single player cannot occupy multiple slots.
- Show your personal best score between sessions.
- Automatically filter inappropriate names and prevent abuse.

## 3. Information sharing and disclosure
- **Public leaderboard** – the player name and score you submit are visible to anyone who plays the game.
- **Service providers** – Google Firebase stores and manages leaderboard data on our behalf.
- We do **not** collect or share other personally identifiable information such as email addresses, IP addresses, or real names.

## 4. Your choices
- **Submit a score** – prompted only when you achieve a new personal best that also qualifies for the top 10 leaderboard. Submitting replaces your previous entry with the new score and name.
- **Skip submission** – you can always decline to submit and keep the score private on your device.

## 5. Data retention
- Leaderboard entries (player name, score, anonymous ID) are kept indefinitely to preserve the historical list of top scores.
- Local data (your personal best) stays on your device until you clear your browser cache or local storage.

## 6. Children’s privacy
Flight ATC is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 7. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated version inside the game and revise the “Last updated” date.
