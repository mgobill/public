[← Back to App Launchpad]({{ '/' | relative_url }})

_Last updated: 2025-12-17_

NestyNote (“we”) helps you log notes and events. This policy explains what we collect, why, and how we handle your data.

## 1. What we collect

- **Account info**: email address, password (stored hashed by Firebase), optional nickname.
- **App data you add**: notes, events, attachments.
- **Device/app info**: basic diagnostics (device type, OS, app version) for performance and error reporting.
- **Usage data**: non-identifying app interactions for troubleshooting and improving features.

## 2. How we use data

- Provide and secure your account.
- Sync and store your notes/events across your devices.
- Improve reliability, performance, and support.

## 3. Where data is stored/processed

Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) hosted by Google Cloud. Data may be processed in the U.S. or other regions where Google Cloud operates.

## 4. Sharing

- We do not sell your data.
- We share with service providers only to run the app (Firebase/Google Cloud).
- We may share if required by law or to protect rights/safety.

## 5. Security

- Transport encryption (HTTPS) for data in transit.
- Authentication managed by Firebase; passwords are hashed.
- Access controls on stored data.

## 6. Retention

- We keep your data while your account is active.
- If you delete data or your account, we remove or anonymize associated data subject to legal/operational retention needs (e.g., backups for a limited period).

## 7. Your choices

- You can view, edit, and delete your notes/events.
- You can delete your account in the app; this removes your profile and stored content after processing.
- You can request access or deletion by contacting us.

## 8. Children

NestyNote is not directed to children under 13 (or under the minimum age in your region).

## 9. Changes

We’ll update this policy if practices change. Continued use after updates means you accept the revised policy.
