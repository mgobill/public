# Suner Privacy Policy

[← Back to App Launchpad]({{ '/' | relative_url }})

_Last updated: 2026-01-08_

Suner (“we”) helps you track net worth, goals, and projections. This policy explains what we collect, why, and how we handle your data.

## 1. What we collect

- **Account info**: email address and password (stored hashed by Firebase) when you choose to sign in.
- **Financial data you enter**: account names, balances, transfers, net worth snapshots, goals, projections, and related settings.
- **Device/app info**: basic diagnostics (device type, OS, app version) for performance and error reporting.
- **Usage data**: non-identifying app interactions for troubleshooting and improving features.

## 2. How we use data

- Provide the core app experience (dashboards, goals, projections, charts).
- Sync and back up your data across devices if you enable cloud backup.
- Improve reliability, performance, and support.

## 3. Where data is stored/processed

- **On device**: your data is stored locally by default.
- **Cloud backup (optional)**: if you sign in, data is stored in Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore) hosted by Google Cloud. Data may be processed in the U.S. or other regions where Google Cloud operates.

## 4. Sharing

- We do not sell your data.
- We share with service providers only to run the app (Firebase/Google Cloud).
- We may share if required by law or to protect rights/safety.

## 5. Security

- Transport encryption (HTTPS) for data in transit.
- Authentication managed by Firebase; passwords are hashed.
- Access controls on stored data.

## 6. Retention

- We keep your data while your account is active.
- If you delete your account, we remove your profile and stored content after processing, subject to limited operational retention (e.g., backups for a short period).

## 7. Your choices

- You can view, edit, and delete your entries, goals, and projections.
- You can disable cloud backup at any time.
- You can request access or deletion by contacting us.

## 8. Children

Suner is not directed to children under 13 (or under the minimum age in your region).

## 9. Changes

We’ll update this policy if practices change. Continued use after updates means you accept the revised policy.
