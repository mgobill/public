# Tepes Privacy Policy

[← Back to App Launchpad]({{ '/' | relative_url }})

_Last updated: 2026-01-11_

This Privacy Policy explains how Tepes collects, uses, and shares information when you use the app.

## 1. Information we collect

### Account information
- **Email address and password** to create and access your account. Passwords are handled by Firebase Authentication.
- **Username/handle** you choose for posting and identification.

### Content you create
- **Tepes (posts):** text, visibility (public or private), timestamps, and the location coordinates tied to each tepe.
- **Optional photos:** images you attach to a tepe.
- **Location labels:** approximate place labels derived from your coordinates (if available).

### Activity data
- **Bookmarks:** tepes you save for later.
- **Reports:** when you report a tepe, we store the report details and your account identifier so we can review it.

### Location data
- **Current device location** is used to show tepes near you and to attach a location when you post a tepe.
- We do not store continuous location history; location is stored only with your posted tepes (and any bookmarked tepes that already include a location).

## 2. How we use your information
- Provide the core app experience (nearby tepes, maps, and posting tools).
- Show your posts, bookmarks, and profile information.
- Moderate content and respond to reports.
- Provide support and troubleshoot issues.

## 3. Information sharing
- **Public tepes** are visible to other users nearby and include the location you chose when posting.
- **Private tepes** are visible only to you in your profile.
- We do not sell your data.
- We share data with service providers only as needed to run the app (Firebase services for authentication, database, and storage).

## 4. Where data is stored
- **Firebase Authentication** stores account credentials.
- **Cloud Firestore** stores tepes, bookmarks, reports, and profile data.
- **Firebase Storage** stores uploaded images.

## 5. Your choices
- You control location access through your device settings.
- You can choose whether each tepe is public or private.
- You can delete your tepes, bookmarks, or your account from the app settings.

## 6. Data retention
- We keep data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service.
- If you delete your account, we remove your profile, tepes, and bookmarks from our systems, subject to routine backup retention.

## 7. Children
Tepes is not directed to children under 13 (or under the minimum age in your region).

## 8. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy. When we do, we will post the updated version here and adjust the date above.
